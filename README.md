# WizSearch üåü
Your intelligent ally for effortless data retrieval across documents and seamless browsing the web.

## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è

We built Wiz Search using the following components:
- **LLM:** [Snowflakes Arctic LLM](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/arctic/) for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Embeddings:** [Snowflakes Arctic Embedding Model](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/introducing-snowflake-arctic-embed-snowflakes-state-of-the-art-text-embedding-family-of-models/) to enhance search relevance.
- **Intelligent Search:** [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) for advanced search capabilities.
- **Vector Databases:** [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Observability:** [Langfuse](https://www.langfuse.com/) for monitoring and observability.
- **UI:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.

We focused on creating a modular architecture without relying on LangChain, allowing for a more customizable and flexible design.
