## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è
We built Wiz Search using the following components:
- **LLM/VLM:** Open source models like llama3.1, mistral, LLaVA, etc are supported by platforms such as [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/models). Closed source models like gpt-4o, gpt-4 supported by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) and [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/ai-services/openai-service) for natural language understanding and generation. [Litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) is used to support all the models.
- **Embeddings:** `jina-embeddings-v3` and `BM25` using [fastembed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) to enhance search relevance.
- **Intelligent Search:** [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) for advanced search capabilities.
- **Vector Databases:** [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Observability:** [Langfuse](https://www.langfuse.com/) for monitoring and observability.
- **UI:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.
